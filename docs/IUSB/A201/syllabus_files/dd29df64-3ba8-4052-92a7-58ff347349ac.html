<h2>Material to be covered:</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">An introductory object-oriented 
programming course for non computer science majors, using the Ruby 
programming language. This course will start with a discussion of object
 oriented programming as a basis for modelling problem domains that 
would lead to the development of solutions using Ruby. <br>
<br>
This course will cover key aspects of the Ruby programming language: 
Installing and Running Ruby, Object-oriented design,Building classes, 
Variable objects,Conditionals, Loops and iterators, Methods, 
Operators,Arrays and Hashes, Inheritance, Software testing, 
Profiling,Threads, Exceptions. The course will also explore key 
components of the Standard Class Library including File I/O,String 
methods, Regular expression methods, Shoe graphics, Interfacing with 
databases.</p>
<h2>Proposed Projects:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tic tac toe game</li>
    <li>Equipment Rental Inventory</li>
    <li>RSS News Feed Filter</li>
    <li>Robot control simulator</li>
    <li>Coke machine simulator (Final project)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Grading:</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Grades for this course will be based on the sum of five parts:</div>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="356">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Worksheets</td>
            <td align="right">100 points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Quizzes</td>
            <td align="right">250 points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Object-oriented design projects</td>
            <td align="right">200 points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Class participation</td>
            <td align="right">50 points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Programming projects</td>
            <td align="right">250 points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Final design/programming project</td>
            <td align="right">150 points</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="right"><b>Total points</b></td>
            <td align="right"><b>1000 points             </b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Software will be graded according the 
Grading Rubic posted on this site. It should be noted that proposed 
Project Designs must be submitted before the programming&nbsp; of a 
project begins. A final design must accompany the source code of 
programming solutions. Points will be deducted if the design and the 
source code do not&nbsp; agree.<br>
<br>
The final grade will be distributed as:</p>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Total points</th>
            <th>
            <p>CorrespondingGrade</p>
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center">(900-1000)</td>
            <td align="center">A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center">(800-899)</td>
            <td align="center">B</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td align="center">C</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

<h2>Rules of conduct:</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">While the use of chat rooms and wikis to
 address technical issues and build computing skills may a new 
experience for many in this class, it has become a common form of 
telecommunication especially among programmers of large Open Source 
software projects like Linux and Gimp. Even the business community has 
been using chat rooms and blogs to enhance communication between project
 participants living in different timezones. This form of communication 
is also relevant to online courses where the students are on different 
time schedules.  <br>
<br>
However, while these services can provide encouragement, insight and 
assistance, they are also governed by the Code of Conduct for Students. 
Submission of work done by someone else is considered plagurism and will
 deprive the offender of both the opportunity to master the skill and 
material covered and a passing grade for this course. Please do not post
 or transmit full solutions on these forums. Instead, it is recommented 
that if a section of code is being stubborn, a test file of no more than
 4 lines of code be developed to demonstrate the problem. Test files 
developed this way can be freely shared and discussed in the wiki and 
chat rooms of this course without penalty.<br>
<br>
To maximize the benefits of these services, the following guidelines are suggested:</div>
<blockquote>
<ol>
    <li><b>Be respectful and considerate:       </b>Disagreement is no 
excuse for poor behavior or personal attacks. Remember that a community 
where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive one. We will be 
covering a lot of ground and we will do better as a group.</li>
    <li><b>Be patient and generous: </b>      If someone asks for help it is because the<img src="dd29df64-3ba8-4052-92a7-58ff347349ac_data/logo-25dpi.png" alt="" align="right">y
 need it. Do politely suggest specific documentation or more appropriate
 venues where appropriate, but avoid aggressive or vague responses. Be 
generous and fair in your use of these services. By helping others you 
are actually increasing your own understanding of the material.</li>
    <li><b>Assume people mean well:</b>       Remember that decisions 
are often a difficult choice between competing priorities. If you 
disagree, please do so politely. If something seems outrageous, check 
that you did not misinterpret it. Ask for clarification, but do not 
assume the worst.</li>
    <li><b>Try to be concise:</b>       Avoid repeating what has been 
said already. People will tend to ignore to long segments of code or 
background to a query. Making an answer longer makes it difficult to 
follow, and people often feel personally attacked if they receive 
multiple messages telling them the same thing.</li>
</ol>
