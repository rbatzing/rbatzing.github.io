					<div class="textPanel">Assignment 1. Designing classes to solve problems.<br>
<br>
Instructions:<br>
<br>
Read through the following problem descriptions and use UMLet to design 
the classes needed to address the issues raised. In your diagram, depict
 all attributes and methods as well as any relationships or reference 
that would be needed between the various classes you have. Remember you 
are only designing the composition and structure of the classes of the 
objects in these problem domains. I am not expecting you to do any Ruby 
programming at this point of time.<br>
<br>
You will need to develop a class inheritance diagram and a class 
decomposition diagram for each of these problems. Please export your 
diagrams as PDF files that you submit to your drop box for grading.<br>
<br>
<br>
Problem 1. A baby sitter's helper<br>
<br>
Bill, a computer science geek,&nbsp; has been hired by his brother's 
wife to watch over their 3 children (Mary aged 5, George aged 3, and 
Peter aged 1) while they go away on an overnight trip to Upper Sandusky.
 Mary only eats potatoes, peas and ham and she can watch 2 hours of 
television but should be put to bed at 8:45pm. She is not permitted to 
eat in front of the TV. George loves eating french fries and a 
hamburger&nbsp; while watching television with his sister. He should go 
to bed at 8:00PM. Bill should wake him about 10:30 to send him to the 
bathroom so he does not wet his bed. Peter only eats canned baby food 
and just loves spinach and turkey. He normally eats at 5:00PM and after 
eating he will play for a half an hour then fall asleep for about 3 
hours. Bill will need to change his diapers when he wakes up and after 
you clean him up, give him a bottle of formula. At about midnight, Bill 
will need to change his diapers. Normally he will not wake up and will 
sleep soundly until 6AM when Bill will need to change him and given him a
 bottle of formula. George will wake up about&nbsp; 7:30 and want 
pancakes for breakfast. Bill should wake Mary up at 9:00 and she 
normally eats waffles.<br>
<br>
Bill wants to write an application that tracks the timing of all the 
tasks he has to do and be able to find out what he has to do next and 
list any task that is overdue. He also wants to be able to check on any 
one of the children and see what tasks he has completed and determine 
what he is supposed to do for the child next.<br>
<br>
For extra credit, expand the model to allow Bill to store the URL of 
how-to sites on the Internet to help him with tasks he is unfamilar with
 (such as heating formula or changing diapers). He will need to have a 
way to activte the link within a web browser.<br>
<br>
Problem 2. Tour bus<br>
<br>
You run a small bus company that provides transportation to guided 
tours. For each of these tours, your affliate company run by your sister
 provides the guide and a list of people to be picked up at their 
respective hotels. The tour has an itinerary of 8 places. There are 
often optional legs to the tour that individuals can elect to join while
 the remainder stay at their current location. Your responsibility is to
 provide transportation and to ensure that you do not loose any one in 
the process. You want to create an application that will allow you to 
track who joins the tour and the various optional segments. From this, 
you should be able to develop a list of who is on the bus at each stop 
of the tour. To make things easier for you, your sister has created a 
cool badge that all participants wear so that you can identify people by
 name or badge number. However, people change their minds often and you 
program needs to be able to enter and annotate last minute cancellations
 of tours or optional segments.<br>
<br>
Problem 3. Tetris game:<br>
<br>
I would like you to come with the up object design that would be needed 
for creating a program in which you could play Tetris. For those not 
familar with the game, here is a brief summary from Wikipedia. (Beware 
of adding too much information to your object model of the game.):<br>
<br>
<i><b>Tetris</b></i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language" target="_blank">Russian</a>: Тетрис) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game" target="_blank">puzzle video game</a> originally des<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorodnicyn_Computing_Centre" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="ef66f06a-74eb-45cf-a362-7fe8e7e0c1a9_data/Picture_3.xml" align="right"></a>igned and programmed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov" target="_blank">Alexey Pajitnov</a> in June 1985, while working for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorodnicyn_Computing_Centre" target="_blank">Dorodnicyn Computing Ce</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorodnicyn_Computing_Centre" target="_blank">ntre</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences" target="_blank">Academy of Science of the USSR</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow" target="_blank">Moscow</a>. He derived its name from the Greek numerical prefix "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetra-" target="_blank">tetra-</a>", as all of the game's pieces (known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrominoes" target="_blank">Tetrominoes</a>) contain four segments, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis" target="_blank">te</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis" target="_blank">nnis</a>, Pajitnov's favorite sport.<br>
<br>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator" target="_blank">pseudorandom</a> sequence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino" target="_blank">tetrominoes</a>
 (sometimes called "tetrads" in older versions)—shapes composed of four 
square blocks each—fall down the playing field. The object of the game 
is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and 
rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal 
line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears,
 and all rows containing blocks above the deleted line will fall one 
level.&nbsp;   As the game progresses, the tetrominoes fall faster, and 
the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the 
playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. The game score 
is calculated by adding the sum of all tiles deleted with the 
disappearance of completed lines,&nbsp; to half the number of colored 
tiles left on the screen. The user should be able to view the game rate 
(in bricks added per min), the current game score and the shape of the 
next piece to fall.<br>
